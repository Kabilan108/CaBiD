abstract: Identifying genes with higher expression in tumor or metastatic
  tissues can help in better understanding tumor formation and can serve as 
  biomarkers of progression or as potential therapy targets. In this project,
  the main goal is to discover potential cancer biomarkers by assessing genomic
  data from cancer patients with different cancer types by performing
  differential gene expression. A graphical user interface (GUI) is created in
  this project as a tool to highlight the difference between normal and tumoral
  patients for a given cancer type and preprocessed GSE dataset selected
  ondemand by the user. The GUI is created in Python and data utilized in this
  project is from gene expression omnibus (GEO) and CuMiDa. The key features of
  this tool revolve around performing differential gene expression analysis
  between normal and tumoral samples for specific cancer types and visualizing
  results in volcano plots and heatmaps.
